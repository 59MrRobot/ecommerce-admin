This is an admin site, which serves as an extension of my [e-commerce site](https://59mrrobot.github.io/ecommerce-site/). Only users who are admins can access the site. The admins are allowed to view the sales statistics of the e-commerce site and they are also allowed to create, delete and update users and products.
